TODO list:
 - check for bugs related to the structure change (moving everything in maps/) -zorun

 - 'make all' : the -j option gets discarded sometimes in the way (yeah, I own a quad core server and I want compilation to be fast :) ) -zorun

 - Have level files loaded as-needed instead of pre-loaded all at once. No need to tie up all that memory (albeit just a little) for levels that may not be played this session. -Joe

 - Get to code and use the new file manager, see src/ap_filemgr.h -zorun

 - Create a "mappack" structure that hold everything related to it : name, maxlevel, rawmaps, Pager, ObjectManager... would be cleaner than the current bunch of global variables. -zorun
