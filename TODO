TODO list (but others might fix or implement it):
 - check for bugs related to the structure change (moving everything in maps/) -zorun

 - level 3 of n_a_portal: as the end of the file does not contain a "new line" caracter, it makes libc crash heavily while parsing in ap_play.cpp... wtf?? see also levels from raisonbran.

 - cleanup the code dedicated to path handling, maybe create something like 'ap_file.cpp'?
   seeing a lot of #ifdef just to change a / into \\ really bugs me... there must be an higher-level solution to do this.
   also clean up the userpath/basepath stuff, a global declaration wasn't the best solution -zorun

 - crashes with some map packs (try 'ratfink' for the main menu), seems related to music and maybe the structure change (perhaps things aren't being unloaded/reallocated properly -jl) -zorun

 - 'make all' : the -j option gets discarded sometimes in the way (yeah, I own a quad core server and I want compilation to be fast :) ) -zorun

 - Have level files loaded as-needed instead of pre-loaded all at once. No need to tie up all that memory (albeit just a little) for levels that may not be played this session. -Joe
