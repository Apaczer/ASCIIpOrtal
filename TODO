TODO list from zorun (but others might fix or implement it):
 - check for bugs related to the structure change (moving everything in maps/)

 - cleanup the code dedicated to path handling, maybe create something like 'ap_file.cpp'?
   seeing a lot of #ifdef just to change a / into \\ really bugs me... there must be an higher-level solution to do this.
   also clean up the userpath/basepath stuff, a global declaration wasn't the best solution

 - crashes with some map packs (try 'ratfink' for the main menu), seems related to music and maybe the structure change

 - 'make all' : the -j option gets discarded sometimes in the way (yeah, I own a quad core server and I want compilation to be fast :) )
