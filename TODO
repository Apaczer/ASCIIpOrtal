TODO list:
 - 'make all' : the -j option gets discarded sometimes in the way (yeah, I own a quad core server and I want compilation to be fast :) ) -zorun

 - The mouse events should not do anything (ie. returning ERR), but they do have an effect sometimes. -zorun

 - Refactor all of the user interaction (displaying menus, etc). Could use some curses wrapper (although many of them seem abandonned). Also, wtf, curses has a structure called a *window*, that makes things easier (no need to always stay in the main stdscr)
